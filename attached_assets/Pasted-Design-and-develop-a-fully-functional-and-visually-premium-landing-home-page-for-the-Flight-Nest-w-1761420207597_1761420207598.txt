Design and develop a fully functional and visually premium landing (home) page for the Flight Nest website that reflects a modern, professional, and conversion-focused travel and visa service brand. Use the existing color palette (Dark Teal / Navy Blue, Gold accents, and White backgrounds) and maintain consistent fonts such as Poppins or Montserrat, rounded buttons, smooth spacing, and responsive layout. The hero section should feature a full-screen background (high-quality tropical island or airplane view) with a semi-transparent dark-blue overlay. On the left side, display a bold headline “Your Gateway to Hassle-Free Visa & Travel Services” followed by subtext “Book your visa appointment and plan your dream trip in one place.” On the right side, embed the booking form (as shown in the provided screenshot) inside a stylish box with gold borders, soft shadows, and a glassmorphism effect. The form must include all fields — Departure Place, Departure Date, Return Date, Destination, Full Name, Email, Phone Number, Infants, Children, Adults, Nationality, and Current Country of Stay — along with a gold “Send Now” button featuring a hover glow animation. Include form validation and a confirmation message: “Thank you! Our representative will contact you within 24 hours.” Below the hero, add an interactive Partner Airlines slider showcasing logos like Emirates, Turkish Airlines, Qatar Airways, and VFS Global under the heading “Trusted by Leading Airlines & Visa Centers.” Next, introduce a Quick Visa Checker widget (Country + Visa Type dropdown + “Check Requirements” button) followed by a Top Destinations Gallery (Paris, Dubai, Bali, Switzerland, Maldives, London) in a hover-effect grid where each block reveals an “Apply Now” button. Add a “Why People Love Flight Nest” section with four animated cards: Fast Visa Processing, Worldwide Support, Custom Trip Planning, and Dedicated Assistance. Then, display Featured Packages / Trending Trips in a modern carousel with price, duration, and a gold “View Details” button, supported by a filter bar (All | Europe | Asia | Family | Honeymoon). Below that, create a 4-step visual process (Fill Out Form → Review → Schedule Appointment → Get Visa Confirmation) with animated icons and connectors. Include a Testimonial Slider with real or placeholder reviews, ratings, and user avatars, followed by a mini FAQ accordion showing 3–4 common questions with a “View All FAQs” button. Add a Travel Inspiration Blog Preview displaying the latest 3 posts with image thumbnails, titles, dates, and “Read More” links under the heading “Explore the World with Flight Nest Stories 🌍.” Before the footer, insert a Call-to-Action strip saying “✈️ Ready to Begin Your Journey? Get Your Schengen Visa Appointment in Just 24 Hours!” with a gold “Apply Now” button. Finally, enhance the footer exclusively for the homepage with an Instagram image gallery of 4–6 recent posts linking to the official Instagram profile under the title “Follow Our Travel Moments on Instagram 📸.” Ensure all sections use smooth scroll animations (Framer Motion / AOS), maintain perfect responsiveness, and keep these homepage-exclusive elements (Hero Booking Form, Partner Slider, Visa Checker, Destinations Gallery, Testimonials, CTA Strip, and Instagram Feed) visible only on the landing page. The overall result should be a beautiful, interactive, and fully functional homepage that feels luxurious, trustworthy, and optimized for conversions.
